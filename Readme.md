In this project, I built a dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.
