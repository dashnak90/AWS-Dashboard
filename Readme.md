# AWS-Dashboard
###### This project was completed in Week 5 of the Data Science bootcamp at SPICED Academy.
In this project, I built a dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.
The data was imported into a local Postgres database, then uploaded to AWS RDS server. Then Metabase was installed on AWS EC2 instance and connected to RSD. Finally, the Dashboard below was built on Metabase using SQL queries.
